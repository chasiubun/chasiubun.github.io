        <h1>Statement of Faith</h1>
        The following is a statement of faith upheld by this company. While it is based off of common church statement of faiths, this is written by the owner and its terms specified for the services provided.
        <h1>The Bible</h1>
        The Bible is God’s revelation composed of the 66 books that constitute the very word of God, inspired in all of its parts by the Holy Spirit to be written and recorded by human authors. The Bible holds God’s objective truth, absolutely authoritative over all men and nothing stands above God’s word to hold judgment over it. The Bible has been given by God to reveal God, his plan of salvation, and what God requires of all men pertaining to life and godliness. It is the duty of all Christians to ascertain the fullness of what God has provided in the Bible and live a life consistent to its content.
        <h1>God</h1>
        There is one true and living God who eternally exists in the three persons, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God simply possesses all life, goodness, and glory in and of Himself. He alone is all-sufficient and is not in need of any creature, rather he has created all things to manifest his glory in, by, unto, and upon these creatures.
        <h1>Creation</h1>
        God created the world in six literal days and rested on the seventh. All things were created with an obligation to be subject to and to worship God. On the sixth day, God created mankind in his own image and called this act of creation very good. Every human is likewise created in God’s image and retains the honors and value of an image bearer at every phase of life from conception and through advanced and debilitating age. While sin taints and mars the image of God displayed in man, every person’s honor and value as an image-bearer cannot be diminished by any means.
        <h1>Fall</h1>
        Due to the fall of Adam in the Garden of Eden, all of mankind and all of creation have been corrupted by sin. Death was introduced to the world in both moral ramifications and external ramifications. Firstly, the corruption of sin has tainted man to total depravity so that every act he does has some taint of sin upon it, creating a moral corruption. The corruption of sin has also affected the external creation so that all things decay. Disease and death are effects of the fallen world, even though there are cases where disease is not linked to any particular sin
        <h1>Salvation</h1>
        Salvation comes from the hand of God as a gift through the penal substitution of the Messiah, Jesus who paid the penalty of sin in the place of those whom he saves. Jesus took upon himself the wrath of God rightly deserved by sinners and simultaneously, the righteousness of Jesus was imputed upon those he saves so that God would look upon the saved and see the righteousness of God.
        <br>
        Jesus died through crucifixion, was buried, and was resurrected to life three days later. Those who are united with Jesus by faith will likewise be raised to new life after their death.
        <br>
        Those who receive saving faith as a gift are preserved in salvation for the full duration of their life. Those who fall under sin are continually drawn back to a life of active and genuine repentance. Those who fall sick and are unable to express their faith due to debilitating diseases such as dementia and comas are likewise preserved by God, having no righteous works of their own, but having the seal of the Holy Spirit.
        <h1>Church</h1>
        The church is comprised of God’s people whom he has chosen for himself. While there is a universal singular group of people whom God has saved out of the world, there are various local churches established in the world to do the ministry God has called his people to. The church is called to gather regularly as a body united by faith under pastors to the commitment of the worship of God through preaching, sacrament, prayer, discipleship, and fellowship.
        <h1>End Times</h1>
        The consummation of creation will happen at some point in the future when the Lord Jesus returns, descending from heaven. When this time comes, all creation will be renewed and the living and the dead will either have their righteousness or guilt declared. Those who have received saving faith in Jesus will enter the eternal joy of communion with their God while those who have been condemned already by their own sin will enter the eternal torment of retribution for their sins. Therefore, the duty of the sinner who lives today is to behold and believe the saving work of Jesus Christ. The duty of the saved is similar in proclaiming the gospel they have believed to both other believers and those who do not believe.
