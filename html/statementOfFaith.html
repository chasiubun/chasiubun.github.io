          <h1>Statement of Faith</h1>
          The following is a statement of faith upheld by those who work under
          <em>Psalm and Song: Music Therapy Services</em>. While this statement
          is modeled off common church statement of faiths, this is written by
          the founder of <em>Psalm and Song</em> and its terms have been
          specified in relation to the services provided.
          <h1>The Bible</h1>
          The Bible is God’s revelation composed of the 66 books that constitute
          the very word of God, inspired in all of its parts by the Holy Spirit
          to be written and recorded by human authors. The Bible holds God’s
          objective truth and is absolutely authoritative over all men. Nothing
          stands above God’s word to hold judgment over it. The Bible has been
          given by God through human authors by divine inspiration to reveal
          God, his plan of salvation, and what God requires of all men
          pertaining to life and godliness. It therefore is the duty of all
          Christians to ascertain the fullness of what God has provided in the
          Bible and live a life consistent to its content.
          <h1>God</h1>
          There is one true and living God who eternally exists in the three
          persons, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God is not a sum of many
          attributes, rather God simply possesses all life, goodness, and glory
          in and of Himself. He alone is all-sufficient and is not in need of
          any creature, rather he has created all things to manifest his glory
          in, by, unto, and upon these creatures. As Christians have
          historically professed, here is only one true and living God in whom
          subsist three distinct persons, yet sharing one single essence. This
          is known as the trinity.
          <h2>God the Father</h2>
          God the Father the origin and cause of all things.
          <h2>God the Son</h2>
          The Son is the true image of the Father. In the beginning, the Son was
          with the Father and therefore was not created. The Son was with the
          Father in heaven until his earthly ministry on earth. In his first
          advent, the Son came as a propitiation for sin to save sinners. All
          who believe the gospel of Jesus Christ are united with Jesus by faith.
          Jesus died for the elect and took upon the penalty for their sin while
          simultaneously imputing his righteousness upon them. After three days,
          Jesus was raised to life in the power of the Spirit and ascended to
          heaven. The next advent of Jesus will lead to the consummation of all
          things where the wicked and judged and those who are saved, the
          church, will be brought before Him for eternal communion and
          fellowship.
          <h2>God the Holy Spirit</h2>
          God the Holy Spirit is proceeds from the Father and the Son and is the
          eternal power of God. When the sinner, dead in his or her sin,
          receives life from God, they are indwelt by the Holy Spirit. The Holy
          Spirit sanctifies the Christian by identifying sin to the Christian
          and providing them the power to live a life of repentance by turning
          to God's salvation in Jesus. The Holy Spirit also serves the believer
          as an eternal seal of salvation to preserve the Christian in the faith
          against all the powers of sin, Satan, and death.
          <h1>Creation</h1>
          God created the world in six literal days and rested on the seventh.
          All things were created with an obligation to be subject under and to
          worship God. On the sixth day, God created mankind in his own image
          and called this act of creation very good. Every human is likewise
          created in God’s image and retains the honors and value of an image
          bearer at every phase of life from conception and through advanced and
          debilitating age. While sin taints and mars the image of God displayed
          in man, every person’s honor and value as an image-bearer cannot be
          diminished by any means.
          <h1>Fall</h1>
          Due to the fall of Adam through the first sin in the Garden of Eden,
          all of mankind and all of creation have been corrupted by sin. Death
          was introduced to the world in both moral ramifications and external
          ramifications. Firstly, the corruption of sin has tainted man to total
          depravity so that every act he does has some taint of sin upon it,
          creating a moral corruption. The corruption of sin has also affected
          the external creation so that all things decay. Disease and death are
          effects of the fallen world, even though there are cases where disease
          is not linked to any particular sin
          <h1>Salvation</h1>
          Salvation comes from the hand of God as a gift through the penal
          substitution of the Messiah, Jesus who paid the penalty of sin in the
          place of those whom he saves. Jesus took upon himself the wrath of God
          rightly deserved by sinners and simultaneously, the righteousness of
          Jesus was imputed upon those he saves so that God would look upon the
          saved and see the righteousness of God.
          <p>
            Jesus died through crucifixion, was buried, and was resurrected to
            life three days later. Those who are united with Jesus by faith will
            likewise be raised to new life after their death.
          </p>
          Those who receive saving faith as a gift are preserved in salvation
          for the full duration of their life. Those who fall under sin are
          continually drawn back to a life of active and genuine repentance.
          Those who fall sick and are unable to express their faith due to
          debilitating diseases such as dementia and comas are likewise
          preserved by God, having no righteous works of their own, but having
          the seal of the Holy Spirit.
          <h1>Church</h1>
          The church is comprised of God’s people whom he has chosen for
          himself. While there is a universal singular group of people whom God
          has saved out of the world, there are various local churches
          established in the world to do the ministry God has called his people
          to. The church is called to gather regularly as a body united by faith
          under pastors to the commitment of the worship of God through
          preaching, sacrament, prayer, discipleship, and fellowship. Pastors
          are ordained according to the qualifications set by God in 1st Timothy
          3:1-7 and are tasks with equipping the saints for the work of the
          ministry. According to this verse, the congregants are tasks with the
          work of the ministry, to live out all holiness in gospel ministry to
          those in their sphere. While the church has an external ministry of
          evangelism, most of the commands God provide in the Epistles are
          exercised within the church such as the preservation of unity and
          sound doctrine in the church.
          <h1>End Times</h1>
          The consummation of creation will happen at an unknown time in the
          future when the Lord Jesus returns, descending from heaven. When this
          time comes, all creation will be renewed and the living and the dead
          will either have their righteousness or guilt declared. Those who have
          received saving faith in Jesus will enter the eternal joy of communion
          with their God while those who have been condemned already by their
          own sin will enter the eternal torment of retribution for their sins.
          Therefore, the duty of the sinner who lives today is to behold and
          believe the saving work of Jesus Christ. The duty of the saved is
          similar in proclaiming the gospel they have believed to both other
          believers and those who do not believe.
