          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p> Ben Siu is a Board Certified Music Therapist in Orange County, California. He holds a B.M. in Music Therapy from University of the Pacific in Stockton, California where he graduated in 2019. Ben took an internship in the Bay Area with a non-profit hospice company where he brought on afterwards full-time  before he moved back down to Orange County. 
          <p>Ben holds a board certification from the <a href="https://www.cbmt.org/">Certification Board of Music Therapy</a> which administers a national music therapy certification examination to measure skills, knowledge, and ability to engage in professional music therapy practice. Qualified individuals who pass board certification earn the credential MT–BC, Music Therapist–Board Certified.</p>
          <h2>Testimony</h2>
          <p>By God's mercy and salvation, Ben was brought to saving faith through the faithful preaching of the gospel by many brothers and sister in the church. God meant what he simply says in his word. God revealed to Ben that he was a sinner, yet through the lovingkindness of God, he sent Jesus to take the penalty of sin and die on the cross. Jesus saved sinners by becoming accursed, taking upon their penalty of sin under God's wrath and simultaneously imputing his sinless righteousness on those he saves. Yet death could not hold Jesus and He was raised to life. Having understood this and professing Jesus as Lord and Savior, Ben has comitted his life to the worship of the one and true living God in continual repentence and turning to Him in faith in all things.</p>
