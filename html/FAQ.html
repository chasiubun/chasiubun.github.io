        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h2>What is Music Therapy?</h2>
        Music therapy is the clinical practice of using evidence-based music
        interventions to address individualized health goals of clients within a
        therapeutic relationship. The music therapist harnesses the potential of
        music in the client's life to maximize the benefit he or she can receive
        through music. These music-based interventions have shown through
        research studies to decrease pain, improve reality orientation and
        focus, reduce anxiety and depression symptoms, and increase reminiscence
        and memory recall.
        <h2>Who is the Music Therapist?</h2>
        Music therapy is practiced by those who hold a Board Certification in
        Music Therapy after completing a degree program and passed the board
        certification exam (See the "Music Therapy" page at the top of the website). 
        Music therapists generally work across many settings
        and people such as children and adults with developmental disorders,
        mental health, hospice care, and more.
        <h2>
          What is the difference between having a music therapist and using a CD
          player?
        </h2>
        What seperates using a CD player versus music therapy visitation is the therapeutic relationship. 
        Every person who has dementia experiences it differently. Memory, level
        of speech, processing information, musical experiences, church involvement, and
        socialization vary from person to person. While listening
        to a CD player can have some level of benefit for many people to connect to music,
        a music therapist possesses the training to know how to maximize the
        potential of the use of music for each individual person. The music
        therapist can assess the most effective way to engage with the individual client and provide guidance
        to the family and other visiting church member to maximize the time spent each visit as dementia and Alzheimer’s progresses.
        <h2>
          What is the difference between having a music therapist and a music
          volunteer?
        </h2>
        Many church members can benefit from the regular visitation of music
        volunteers. <em>Psalm and Song</em> want to emphasize the importance of church visitation as much as is available from the client's local church. Some of the difficulties that may cause difficulties during these visits may include difficulties in communication, unexpected agitation or anxiety, or complications in navigating through memory deficits. The music
        therapist can assess the most effective way to engage with the individual client and provide guidance
        to the family and other visiting church member to maximize the time spent each visit as dementia and Alzheimer’s progresses.
        <p>
          For example, music therapists are trained to know how to assess
          communication difficulties for nonverbal clients and those with
          more severe cognitive impairments. With the assessment will come the appropriate adaptation to meet clients where they are in their stage of life or disease. Music therapists also are equipped to
          know how to adapt music to sustain a client's attention to the
          music and to create song-based discussion that will be meaningful. While
          some clients are more withdrawn, a music therapist will have the
          skill to know how to draw out the client's interactions.
        </p>
        <h2>What would the process look like for me to have music therapy services for my loved one?</h2>
          <p>To contact me, please visit the "Contact" page at the top of the website. There you will find my e-mail where we may begin communication for what I will mention below.</p>
          <p>
            Before music therapy visits begin, I will have a meeting with whoever is involved in the client’s care (most likely family). In this meeting, we can discuss the situation your loved one is in and how music therapy may be of benefit to him or her. Some of the things discussed may include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Medical History as it relates to what I may encounter during a music
              therapy visit
            </li>
            <li>Spiritual History</li>
            <li>Music Preferences</li>
            <li>Who is involved in the client’s life</li>
            <li>Family Goals</li>
            <li>Client Goals</li>
            <li>Cost (For information on cost, please visit the "Cost" page at the top of the website)</li>
            <li>Timing for a first visit</li>
          </ul>
          One the first visit, I will have family or whoever is managing care for the client to introduce me to him or her. On this first visit, I will get to know the
          client, share music with them, and see how they respond to
          music. For each following visit, if the family or other church members would like
          to join in the visit, I would be happy to have them join. 
          <p>
            A visit will last an average of 40 minutes depending on how much energy the client has. The format a visit may
            usually appear are as follows:
          </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Check-in</li>
              <li>Warm-up Song, Singing or Instrument Playing or Music Listening</li>
              <li>
                Song-Based Discussion Around a Biblical Theme: Grace, Faith,
                Assurance, Thanksgiving, etc. (The type of discussion will be adapted to meet each client where they are at.)
              </li>
              <li>Warm-Down Song</li>
              <li>Prayer</li>
              <li>
                Check-in/Update with Family/Persons involve in care for the
                client
              </li>
            </ol>
          <p>After the first visit, we can debrief and discuss how the visit went including things we noticed, positive outcomes, and other considerations. Afterwards, we can discuss if you would like to continue having music therapy services for your loved one and how frequent each visit may be</p>
          <p>
            After my first visit and subsequent visits, I will do my own documentation with a visit summary
            and any other observations. These notes will be sent to those whom the
            family designates too receive them.
