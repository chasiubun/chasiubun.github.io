    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <h2>What is Music Therapy?</h2>
        Music therapy is the clinical practice of using music to address individual health goals of patients/clients. The music therapist harnesses the positive potential of music in patient/client’s life to maximize the benefit he or she can receive through music. These music-based interventions have shown through research studies to decrease pain, improve reality and focus for those with cognitive impairments, reduce anxiety and depression symptoms, and increase reminiscence and memory.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Who is the music therapist?</h2>
        Music therapy is practiced by those who hold a Board Certification in Music Therapy after completing a degree program and passed the board certification exam. Music therapists generally work across many settings and people such as children and adults with developmental disorders, mental health, hospice care, and more.
        <br>
        <br>
    <h2>What is the difference between having a music therapist and a CD player?</h2>
        Every person who has dementia experiences it differently. Memory, level of speech, understanding, musical experiences, church involvement, and connection with other people vary from person to person. While listening to a CD player might be beneficial for many people to connect to music, a music therapist possesses the training to know how to maximize the potential of the use of music for each individual person. The music therapist can assess what works for each individual and provide guidance to the family and other visiting churchmen to maximize the interactions they have as dementia and Alzheimer’s progresses.
        <br>
        <br>
    <h2>What is the difference between having a music therapist and a music volunteer?</h2>
        Many church members can benefit from the regular visitation of music volunteers. The music therapist has additional training to meet, sustain, and maximize the benefit a client/patient may receive through clinical and musical expertise. 
        <br>
        For example, music therapists are trained to know how to navigation communication difficulties for nonverbal clients/patients and those with more severe cognitive impairments. Music therapists are also trained to know how to adapt music to sustain a client/patient’s attention to the music and to create song-based discussion that will be meaningful. While some patient/clients are more withdrawn, a music therapist will have the skill to know how to draw out
        <br>
        <br>
    <h2>What would a music therapy visit with you look like?</h2>
        Before the music therapy visit begins, I will have a meeting with family or whoever is involved in the patient/client’s care. In this meeting, I would like to have a basic idea of:
        <ul>
            <li>Spiritual History</li>
            <li>Medical History as it relates to what I may encounter during a music therapy visit</li>
            <li>Music Preferences</li>
            <li>Who is involved in the patient/client’s life</li>
            <li>Family Goals</li>
            <li>Patient/Client Goals</li>
        </ul>
    
        The first visit will involve the family introducing me to the patient/client. On this first visit, I will get to know the patient/client, share music with them, and see how they respond to music.
        For each visit, if the family or other church members would like to join in the visit, they are welcome to do so. If you contact me, we can find a time for you to join the visit. The format a visit may usually appear are as follows:
    <ol>
        <li>Check-in</li>
        <li>Warm-up Song, Singing, Instrument Playing</li>
        <li>Song-Based Discussion Around a Biblical Theme: Grace, Faith, Assurance, Thanksgiving, etc.</li>
        <li>Warm-Down Song</li>
        <li>Prayer</li>
        <li>Check-in/Update with Family/Persons involve in care for the patient/client</li>
    </ol>
    
    After my visit, I will do my own documentation with a visit summary and any other observations. These notes will be sent to those whom the family designates too receive them.    </div>
